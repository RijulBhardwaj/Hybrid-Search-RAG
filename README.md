This repository showcases a RAG Hybrid Search implementation, combining retrieval-based methods with generative models to deliver accurate and context-aware responses.
 The system leverages dense retrieval to find relevant documents and a generative model to craft coherent answers, making it ideal for complex queries requiring detailed information synthesis.
